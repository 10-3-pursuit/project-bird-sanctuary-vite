This easy-to-use website allows you to virtually adopt and support the birds at our sanctuary. You can browse our beautiful birds, learn about them, and choose which ones you'd like to adopt. Let's get you started!
​

### Getting Started 🦉

​

1. **Visit the Website**: Open your web browser and navigate to our Bird Sanctuary website.
   ​
2. **Explore Birds**: You'll see a collection of birds available for adoption. Each bird's card will show you a picture, name, and adoption price.
   ​
3. **Adopting a Bird**: When you find a bird you love, click the 'Adopt' button on its card. This will add the bird to your virtual cart.
   ​

### Managing Your Cart 🦜

​

1. **View Your Cart**: You can view the birds you've selected at any time by looking at your cart, located on the left side of the page.
   ​
2. **Duplicate Selection**: If you accidentally try to adopt the same bird twice, don't worry! The website will remind you that you've already chosen that bird.
   ​
3. **Remove a Bird**: Changed your mind? You can remove a bird from your cart anytime before finalizing your adoption.
   ​
4. **Special Discounts**: If you choose to adopt three or more birds, you'll get a 10% discount on your total adoption fee!
   ​

### Bonus Gifts 🦩

- As you adopt more birds and your total adoption cost reaches certain thresholds, you'll be eligible for special bonus gifts. Keep an eye on your cart to see what surprises await!
  ​
