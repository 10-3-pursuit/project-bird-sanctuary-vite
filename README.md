This bird sanctuary app allows you to adopt a bird (or two, or three, or MORE!) But never the same bird twice.

Each bird is displayed in a card with its name, image, price and an ADOPT button.

To adopt a bird, simply click on the ADOPT button.

If you select the same bird twice, an alert will pop up saying

"Bird already chosen."

As you adopt a bird, the total price will update itself.

If you adopt more 3 or more birds, you will be given a 10% discount which is applied automatically.

Additionally, once your cart total reaches an amount of $300 or more, you will be gifted bonus items.

If you find that you added a bird that you did not want, a delete button is available. This will also update the total price accordingly.

Once you have selected the birds of your choice, fill out the form to complete your checkout process. After you are done, click the SUBMIT button and you are done! The page resets itself and is ready for the next user.
